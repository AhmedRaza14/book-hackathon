# Week 15: Capstone Project

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate all learned concepts
- Demonstrate complete Physical AI system
- Present and document project
- Apply research methodology in robotics

## Topics Covered

### Complex Multi-Modal Project
The capstone project represents the culmination of the course, requiring students to integrate concepts from all previous modules into a comprehensive physical AI system. This project should demonstrate:

- Multi-modal perception (vision, language, sensors)
- AI decision-making and planning
- Physical robot control and manipulation
- Human-robot interaction
- Real-world deployment considerations

Projects should address real-world challenges and demonstrate the integration of digital intelligence with physical embodiment.

### Integration of All Components
Successful capstone projects require seamless integration of multiple subsystems:

Perception integration:
- Sensor fusion across multiple modalities
- Real-time processing constraints
- Calibration and synchronization
- Robustness to environmental conditions

Planning and control integration:
- High-level task planning
- Low-level motion control
- Feedback and adaptation mechanisms
- Safety and error handling

Human interaction integration:
- Natural language interfaces
- Social interaction protocols
- Safety and ethical considerations
- User experience design

### Project Presentation and Documentation
