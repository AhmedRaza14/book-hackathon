# Week 13: Human-Robot Interaction

## Learning Objectives
- Design social robotics interactions
- Implement natural language interfaces
- Consider safety and ethics in HRI
- Understand principles of effective human-robot collaboration

## Topics Covered

### Social Robotics Principles
Social robotics focuses on designing robots that can interact with humans in a natural and socially acceptable manner. This involves understanding human social cues, norms, and expectations to create more intuitive and engaging interactions.

Key principles of social robotics include:
- Anthropomorphic design considerations
- Social signal processing
- Theory of mind for robots
- Emotional intelligence in artificial agents
- Cultural adaptation and personalization
- Trust building and maintenance

Social robots must be able to interpret and respond appropriately to human social behaviors such as eye contact, gestures, proxemics (personal space), and turn-taking in conversation.

### Natural Language Interaction
Natural language interaction enables humans to communicate with robots using everyday language. This encompasses both understanding human speech and generating appropriate responses.

Components of natural language interaction:
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR)
- Natural language understanding (NLU)
- Dialogue management
- Natural language generation (NLG)
- Speech synthesis
- Context tracking and memory

Modern approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to create more natural and flexible interactions, though challenges remain in grounding language to the physical world.

### Safety in Human-Robot Collaboration
Safety is paramount in human-robot interaction, especially in collaborative environments. Safety considerations include:

Physical safety:
- Collision avoidance and emergency stops
- Safe force and speed limits
- ISO standards for collaborative robots (ISO/TS 15066)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Physical barriers and safety zones

Psychological safety:
- Predictable robot behavior
- Clear communication of robot intent
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Transparency in decision-making
- Privacy protection

### Ethical Considerations
As robots become more integrated into human society, ethical considerations become increasingly important:

- Privacy and data protection
- Autonomy and human agency
- Bias and fairness in AI systems
- Transparency and explainability
- Responsibility and accountability
- Impact on employment and social structures
- Informed consent for interaction

Ethical frameworks must be integrated into the design process from the beginning to ensure responsible deployment of HRI systems.

## Activities
- Design HRI interface
- Implement natural language system
- Test safety protocols

## Key Equations and Formulas
- Risk = Probability × Severity (ISO 12100 safety framework)
- Trust dynamics: T(t+1) = α × T(t) + (1-α) × [Experience × Reliability]

## Assessment
- HRI system implementation
- Safety and ethics analysis
