# Week 15: Capstone Project

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate all learned concepts
- Demonstrate complete Physical AI system
- Present and document project
- Apply research methodology in robotics

## Introduction

The Capstone Project represents the culmination of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course, requiring students to integrate concepts from all previous modules into a comprehensive physical AI system. This project serves as a demonstration of mastery across the entire curriculum, from foundational concepts to advanced integration techniques.

## Key Concepts
