# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This comprehensive guide bridges the gap between digital AI models and embodied intelligence, focusing on the integration of AI with physical robotics systems.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementation of humanoid robots capable of intelligent interaction with the physical world. You'll explore:

- The transition from digital-only models (LLMs) to Embodied Intelligence
- How to bridge the gap between "Digital Brain" (AI) and "Physical Body" (Robotics)
- Physics-informed AI and natural human interaction
- The use of humanoids as the ultimate form factor for a human-centered world

## Technical Domains Covered

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Nodes, topics, services, actions, and `rclpy`
2. **Digital Twins**: Gazebo and Unity for hardware simulation
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Omniverse, and VSLAM
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrating LLMs/VLMs with robotic control

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with linear algebra and calculus
- Introductory knowledge of machine learning concepts
- Basic understanding of physics and mechanics

## Hardware Requirements

- RTX 4070 or higher GPU recommended for simulation
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- At least 32GB RAM for complex simulations
- Jetson Orin Nano for edge deployment examples

## Getting Started

Begin with Week 1 to establish the foundational concepts of Physical AI, then progress through each week sequentially to build your understanding of humanoid robotics systems.
